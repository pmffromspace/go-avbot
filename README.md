# go-avbot - the aventer bot

AVBOT is a bot for the Matrix Chat System.


## How to use it?

First we have to create a config.yaml inside of data directory that we have to mount into the container. A sample of these config can be found in our Github repository.

```bash
docker run -v ./data:/go-avbot/data:rw avhost/go-avbot:latest
```
